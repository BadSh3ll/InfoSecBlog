<Section>üîç **Nmap History and Evolution**</Section>

Nmap made its debut in the **September 1997** issue of *Phrack Magazine*, and since then, it has become a cornerstone in network reconnaissance. Fast-forward to today, and Nmap is still stealing the spotlight as one of the most powerful and versatile tools for network discovery and cybersecurity auditing.

Originally designed as a simple **port scanner**, Nmap blew minds with its ground-breaking techniques for port discovery. Over the years, it has evolved far beyond its humble beginnings, now standing at the heart of a **family of rockstar networking tools**, including **Ncrack**, **Ncat**, **Nping**, and **Zenmap**. Together, these tools form a powerful toolkit that can handle anything from network mapping to vulnerability assessments, solidifying Nmap's place as a go-to solution for professionals in the field.

And the heart of it all, the **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** is a real game changer, handing you the power to script additional tasks using **Lua**. It‚Äôs just like having a cyber wizard at your fingertips, enabling users to automate complex network reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning.
