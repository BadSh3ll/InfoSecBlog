<Section>Cybersecurity Objectives</Section>

When people think of cybersecurity, they often picture hackers attempting to infiltrate systems to steal sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, credit card details, or even classified military information. While safeguarding confidential data from unauthorized access is a key aspect of cybersecurity, it's crucial to recognize that the field encompasses three interconnected goals.

These three core principles form the CIA Triad: **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**, which together provide a comprehensive framework for protecting information and systems in cybersecurity.

<em>Confidentiality</em> ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information.

<em>Integrity</em> ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or unintentionally.

<em>Availability</em> ensures that information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them.
